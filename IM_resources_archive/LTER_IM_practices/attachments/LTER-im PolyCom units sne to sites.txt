Subject:	[LTER-im] PolyCom units sne to sites

Dear Colleagues:

This week, the LNO sent two of the computer-mounted PolyCom units to each site to an 
address specified by your information manager.  Please be on the lookout for them,.  The 
purpose of these units is to improve communication among sites and scientists.  Our 
suggestion is that one of these units should be assigned to your Information Manager 
because of the frequent need for interaction within this group.  

A follow up message from James Brunt will include licensing information and 
instructions on how to set up the units.  Please keep your eyes open for this message, and 
test out the units as soon as convenient.  Let us know if you are having problems, and we 
will try to address them.  Please write tech_support@lternet.edu with any requests for 
assistance.

Thanks,

Bob
